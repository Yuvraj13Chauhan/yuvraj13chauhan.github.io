I am an M.Sc. graduate in **Physics** from **IIT Delhi**, driven by a strong interest in **quantum computing**, **quantum information**, and **high-energy physics phenomenology**.  
My academic path so far has focused on understanding quantum systems both at the **computational level** (quantum algorithms, Qiskit development, photonic QC) and the **fundamental level** (QCD, diffractive scattering, and gluon dynamics).

I am now preparing for a **PhD in Quantum Computing / Quantum Information Science**, where I aim to work at the intersection of **theory, simulation, and experiment-ready models**.

## About Me

My research experience spans:

- **High-Energy Physics (HEP):**  
  Diffractive scattering, dipole models, saturation physics, and Monte-Carlo event generation (Sartre).

- **Quantum Computing & Information:**  
  Quantum algorithms, circuit construction, MBQC / cluster states, photonic QC, and spin-qubit control.

- **Scientific & Numerical Computing:**  
  Python, C++, Qiskit, numerical methods, simulation building, and code optimization.

Across these areas, I enjoy working on **mathematical structures**, **algorithmic design**, and **turning theory into simulations/code** that help validate ideas.
